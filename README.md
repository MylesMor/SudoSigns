# SudoSigns
A Spigot plugin used to run commands by interacting with a sign. Some inspiration for commands has been taken from [Nokorbis' Command Signs](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/command-signs.10512/), but all the code is my own, and I have also implemented a convenient inventory-based GUI. 
This allows you to perform actions on SudoSigns such as:
* Renaming the SudoSign
* Adding permissions that a player must have to run the sign's commands
* Adding either player or console commands to a sign
* Adding messages which are shown to the player
* Use colour codes (`&`) on the sign for coloured text

For in-depth details on the command, permissions and features of this plugin, visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/MylesMor/SudoSigns/wiki)!

## Installation
1. Download the Spigot plugin [HERE](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/sudosigns-commands-messages-on-signs.80758/).
2. Place the JAR file inside your `./plugins` directory.
3. Reload or restart the server.

## Getting Started
Visit the [Getting Started](https://github.com/MylesMor/SudoSigns/wiki/Getting-Started) page to find out how to setup your first SudoSign!

## Issues
The best course of action would be opening an issue [here](https://github.com/MylesMor/SudoSigns/issues), but I will also try to keep up-to-date with the Spigot comments section.

In your issue report, please include as much information as possible including:
* The Spigot version
* Any errors in the console (please copy these in full)
* The steps to reproduce the issue

## Upcoming Features
These features will be available in future updates!
* Edit the sign's text from the GUI menu.
